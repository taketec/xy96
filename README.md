⚠️The frontend of the app is still in works. Only the backend is done.⚠️
## Introduction -
XY96 is a powerful tool designed to streamline the creation of background environments for 3D art, a typically time-consuming and labor-intensive process for VFX artists. Leveraging state-of-the-art text-to-image generation models and  depth estimation integration, XY96 allows for rapid concept visualization and enhanced realism. With a user-friendly interface, artists can generate high-quality images from text prompts and convert them into usable .glb background files with a single click, simplifying the workflow and saving valuable time. XY96 empowers artists to quickly and efficiently create stunning backgrounds, allowing them to focus on the creative aspects of their projects.

##  Tech stack -
 - React + Electronjs for the frontend. Expressjs, MongoDB. AI models are run on replicate. Payments are done via Razorpay
